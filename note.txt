Subquery: brief summary

- Comparison operators (=, <>, >, <, >=, <=):
  The subquery must return a single value (scalar). Example:
  WHERE value > (SELECT MAX(col) FROM ...)

- IN / NOT IN:
  The subquery must return a single column (a set of values). Example:
  WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM ...)

- ALL / SOME / ANY (used with comparison operators):
  The subquery must return a single column. Example:
  WHERE score > ALL (SELECT score FROM ...)
  WHERE name = ANY (SELECT name FROM ...)

- Important notes:
  - The structure of the subquery result must match the operator being used.
  - Use EXISTS to check for existence only (often more efficient than IN for large subqueries).
  - Use scalar subqueries in SELECT only if the subquery returns at most one row per parent row.
